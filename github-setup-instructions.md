# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To connect this project to your GitHub repository (IlKar0182/Forreplit), follow these steps:

## 1. Add the remote repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/IlKar0182/Forreplit.git
```

## 2. Set the main branch name

```bash
git branch -M main
```

## 3. Push your code to GitHub

When running these commands, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub. You can use:

## Alternative Method: Clone in Desktop

2. Unzip it to your local machine
3. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
4. Connect to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/IlKar0182/Forreplit.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Using the GitHub CLI
